## üîç Technical Achievements

### Hole Detection Algorithm:

1. **Winding Direction Analysis**: CCW (exterior) vs CW (holes)
2. **Area-Based Classification**: Larger paths = exteriors, smaller = holes
3. **Containment Testing**: Point-in-polygon tests to verify hole relationships
4. **Multi-Path Shape Handling**: Properly handles shapes with multiple holes
